Drone Show Software
=========

Drone Show Software is software designed for drone shows, allowing flight path planning as well as control of dozens of drones simultaneously in a synchronized manner.

This repository contains guidelines for building and setting up the drones, WiFi and LED modules as well as adding and setting up RTK GPS units.

Description
-----------

Drone Show Software requires a custom Pixhawk firmware due to special flight mode and commands it uses. Pixhawk hardware or copies thereof can be used. These autopilots are widely available and available for purchase from most drone part dealers.

Drones can be used with standard GPS units, but to ensure flight precision that is necessary for drone shows, we recommend using RTK GPS units.

For establishing reliable communication between multiple drones, we suggest using 5GHz WiFi modules onboard drones rather than standard (433MHz) telemetry data links.
For drone show purposes, drones can be equipped with LED modules or other show elements that can be controlled via PWM servo signal.
